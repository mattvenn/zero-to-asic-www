You're not really going to know what you're going to get out of it. And you're not going to know if what you've actually done is correct, so having an option to take a course with some other people has been a really great way of learning it."

The course is crammed full of interesting material with great pacing and support from Matt, and it's been a fantastic opportunity to meet other folks with shared interests and different backgrounds. The course has left me excited with opportunities for new projects and optimism for some working silicon!"

At the latter parts of course you're simulating the entire Caravel system on chip with a RISCV core. Being able to drill down into everything inside that core, I can log the program counter, I can log all the address and data buses and you can just see in exquisite detail what the system is doing, and it's doing that because I programmed it. Being able to drill down into that detail was really fascinating."

This was all secret stuff and I love that this project is trying to do to silicon design what the open source community has been trying to do with software for the last 30 years. This feels like the next logical step and I think we'll look back and say well of course you can make your own chips that's just a thing and it will just be obvious and commonplace and I look forward to that."
