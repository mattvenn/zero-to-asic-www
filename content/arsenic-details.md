Please contact me to discuss options for you and your team. Let me know your aims and how many people you want to take the course.

> I took the course to primarily learn physical design with the open source flow. The course is very well documented with detailed steps on each part of the flow. During the office hours I could see his hands-on expertise over the whole flow with deep knowledge on what each step. Matt has built a lot of utility tools/scripts to help out with debug and analysis. I'd say he's one of the best engineers I've met who knows how to get the job done! **Would recommend this course to anyone who wants to tape out their own chip.**
