## Important News!

All systems are go for tapeout! You might have seen that [Efabless went out of business](https://tinytapeout.com/efabless-faq). We are now working with [IHP](https://www.ihp-microelectronics.com/) & [ChipFoundry](https://chipfoundry.io) to provide silicon for the course, and you can check the [future schedule here](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/#future-chips).

## Course Overview

-   [Full course details here](/analog_course_content).
-   We will concentrate on analog circuit layout and tapeout.
-   **Circuit design is not covered in the course - you can use one of our examples or bring your own schematic.**
-   A virtual machine is available or you can install the tools manually.
-   The course is continually updated for the latest tooling and PDK.

### Format

-   Support via:
    -   Recorded solutions videos.
    -   Discord community server.
    -   Twice Monthly analog specific call.
    -   1 to 1 office hours with Matt: access to expert help on the Boron and Arsenic level tickets.
-   Asynchronous - do in your own time.
-   Guaranteed ASIC manufacture with [TinyTapeout](https://www.tinytapeout.com) ([specs](https://tinytapeout.com/specs/analog/)).
-   High resolution set of digital images of the decapped ASIC - see [FAQ](#asic-def).
-   Access to the course materials for the lifetime of the course.

## FAQ

#### Can I get a refund?

I'm so confident you will love the course, if for any reason you are unhappy you can ask for a refund within 30 days of purchase.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### Will my design definitely get manufactured? {#asic-def}

Yes! We are now using [TinyTapeout](https://www.tinytapeout.com) to guarantee ASIC manufacture. 

* Silicon ticket includes [2 free tiles](https://tinytapeout.com/faq/#how-big-can-my-design-be) and 2 analog pins. PCB mounted chip is currently $100 extra.
* Boron ticket includes 4 free tiles, 4 analog pins, and 1 PCB mounted chip.

#### How big can I make my custom project? {#how-big}

Your project area starts at 160 x 225 um. You can pay extra for more space. 

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### How long does the whole course take to complete?

It depends on your existing level of experience and how deep you want to go on your own project. Most people can complete the course in 8 weeks, committing about 4 hours per week.
Then you will need some amount of time to prepare your own project.

#### What is the life of the course? {#course-life}

For as long as I'm running this course.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### What is team access? {#team-access}

Take the course with your colleagues. You will work through the course material as a group and submit a single design between you. Weekly sync calls will keep you on track to complete the course.
