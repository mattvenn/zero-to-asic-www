    -   Recorded solutions videos.
    -   Discord community server.
    -   Twice Monthly analog specific call.
    -   1 to 1 office hours with Matt: access to expert help on the Boron and Arsenic level tickets.
-   Asynchronous - do in your own time.
-   Guaranteed ASIC manufacture with [TinyTapeout](https://www.tinytapeout.com) ([specs](https://tinytapeout.com/specs/analog/)).
-   High resolution set of digital images of the decapped ASIC - see [FAQ](#asic-def).

## FAQ

#### Can I get a refund?

I'm so confident you will love the course, if for any reason you are unhappy you can ask for a refund within 30 days of purchase.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### Will my design definitely get manufactured? {#asic-def}

Yes! We are now using [TinyTapeout](https://www.tinytapeout.com) to guarantee ASIC manufacture. 

* Silicon ticket includes [2 free tiles](https://tinytapeout.com/faq/#how-big-can-my-design-be) and 2 analog pins. PCB mounted chip is currently $100 extra.
* Boron ticket includes 4 free tiles, 4 analog pins, and 1 PCB mounted chip.

#### How big can I make my custom project? {#how-big}

Your project area starts at 160 x 225 um. You can pay extra for more space. 

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### How long does the whole course take to complete?

It depends on your existing level of experience and how deep you want to go on your own project. Most people can complete the course in 8 weeks, committing about 4 hours per week.
Then you will need some amount of time to prepare your own project.
