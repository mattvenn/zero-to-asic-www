A shuttle service is the same as a [multi project wafer](/terminology/mpw).

On 30th June 2020, [Tim Ansell](https://twitter.com/mithro) announced the collaboration between Google and Skywater to provide a free shuttle service in his FOSSI dialup talk.

These [slides taken from his talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRtwZPc8ykkkgtUkHkoJZrP9jKOo3FYdKqbg-So0ic6_kx7ha1vHnxrWmuxWkTc9GfC8xl0TfEpMLwK/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000#slide=id.g8a02ce4cad_0_238) show the overview:

## Chip Foundry Shuttle

Normally in an MPW you would have the whole [die](/terminology/die) to yourself. In the [ChipFoundry](https://chipfoundry.io/) Shuttle all the designs will be within the user project area of the [Caravel harness](https://github.com/chipfoundry/caravel). 

Caravel has its own RISCV processor and a neat [datasheet](https://caravel-harness.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
The idea here is to make it easier to bring up and debug your designs at the cost of some area.

Read [this post to find out what you could fit in](/post/how-much-can-we-fit) the user space.

The Google shuttle returned chips in type of packaging called [Wafer Level Chip Scale Packaging](/terminology/wlcsp) and then the easier to handle QFN.
