A Multi Project Wafer is used to reduce the cost of making an [ASIC](/terminology/asic).
By using a lot of different designs on the same [wafer](/terminology/wafer) the Non Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs of making the [mask set](/terminology/maskset) are shared
between all the participants.

The Google [shuttle](/terminology/shuttle) is an example of an MPW.

# Our MPW submissions

So far we have made 4 tapeouts to the Google MPWs:

* [MPW1](/post/asic_submitted)
* [MPW2](/post/mpw2-submitted)
* [MPW3](/post/mpw3)
* [MPW4](/post/mpw4_submitted)

# MPW physical implementation

We sent [John McMaster](https://twitter.com/johndmcmaster) some chips to take a look at from MPW1. Here presented his findings at [OpenTapeOut](https://opentapeout.dev)
