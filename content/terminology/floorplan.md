The floorplanning stage is where [LibreLane](/terminology/librelane) decides how big an area we need to fit everything in.
All the required [standard cells](/terminology/standardcell) are placed in the bottom left corner, ready for the [place and route](/terminology/place_and_route) stage.

All the little rectangles in the centre are called tap cells. They make sure the [MOSFETs](/terminology/mosfet) work correctly by connecting the [P doped](/terminology/doping) [substrate](/terminology/wafer) to ground and the N-wells (that insulate the P-type MOSFETS) to power.

The slightly bigger rectangles at the edges are decoupling capacitors. After the [routing](/terminology/place_and_route) is finished, any spare space is filled up with decoupling capacitors. The job of these capacitors is to make sure that all the cells get a nice smooth power supply.
