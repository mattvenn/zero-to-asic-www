## FAQ

#### Can I get a refund?

I'm so confident you will love the course, if for any reason you are unhappy you can ask for a refund within 30 days of purchase.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### Will my design definitely get manufactured? {#asic-def}

Yes! We are now using [TinyTapeout](https://www.tinytapeout.com) to guarantee ASIC manufacture. 

* Silicon ticket includes [1 free tile](https://tinytapeout.com/faq/#how-big-can-my-design-be). PCB mounted chip is currently $150 extra.
* Boron ticket includes 1 free tile, and 1 PCB mounted chip.

#### How big can I make my custom project? {#how-big}

Your project area starts at 100 x 160um. You can pay extra for more space. 

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### How long does the whole course take to complete?

It depends on your existing level of experience and how deep you want to go on your own project. Most people complete each section in 4 hours, so about 20 hours for coursework.
Then you will need some amount of time to prepare your own project.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### Is there a time limit to complete the course?

You can take as long as you want with the course materials. Office hours expire 3 months after you onboard.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### When do I need to submit my final design?

See [TinyTapeout](https://www.tinytapeout.com) for the next shuttle closing date.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### Do I need an FPGA to develop my design? {#fpga}

For simple and small designs like the ones I include in the course, you can use simulation to check everything is working fine. If you want to make a more complex project, then it’s probably a good idea to test your design on an FPGA.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### What is the life of the course? {#course-life}

For as long as I'm running this course.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### What is team access? {#team-access}

Take the course with your colleagues. You will work through the course material as a group and submit a single design between you. Weekly sync calls will keep you on track to complete the course.

[Back to top](#tickets)

#### Is there a cheaper option? {#grant}

We have a grant that provides a Silicon-level ticket option for the Zero to ASIC course for those unable to afford the course at full price. Please [apply here](https://forms.gle/LAYVnqF1pWbQF5ti6).
