It's become a cliche, but hardware is hard!

One reason why hardware is harder than software is that the time between revisions is often longer. We need to wait for new PCBs, or for components to be delivered. Or for more new PCBs after we realise we got it wrong!

Another reason is that it can be expensive, and not just for the physical components. We generally need more of a lab than software developers. Not just soldering irons and good lighting. **Test gear** is essential for learning how your circuit is actually behaving, matching simulation to the real world. And it's usually expensive.

I struggled with the cost of hardware development for years, and when someone donated me my first oscilloscope it was a big deal! Seeing the waveforms really helped me to advance my understanding and the complexity of the projects I could undertake.

[Last year I awarded 10 grants](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/post/test-equipment-grant/) to people all over the world. This year I'm going to piggyback on Digilent's Cyber Week sale, and cover up to 75% of the cost of the [Digilent Analog Discovery 3](https://digilent.com/shop/analog-discovery-3/).

> "Thanks so much to Matt's grant! I was able to get a Digilent Analog Discovery, and it quickly became one of my go-to workshop tools. Having the ability to see voltage signals, capture waveforms, and measure impedance made a huge difference: no more guessing from vague multimeter readings! It really helped me dive deeper and accelerate my projects!" Guillaume.

> "I vividly remember taking up the subject of communication systems and somewhat struggling with the practical or hands-on component of it. Not because I lacked interest or intuition, but because writing codes and running simulations on MATLAB felt dull and boring; it created no waves in the air and certainly not in my mind — felt like a grey loop of effort without spark . But thanks to the test equipment grant by Matt Venn, the entire subject went from dull and boring to fun and scoring." Ram.
