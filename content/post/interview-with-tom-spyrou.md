Tom Spyrou is a long time EDA developer who has worked at large and small companies.

* In 1988 Developed QTV at VLSI technology. It was the first STA engine to be trusted to sign off devices for fabrication without timing based simulation. 
* He was the original architect of PrimeTime STA algorithm.
* Manager of Cadence Common timing Engine and precursor to Open Access
* Senior technical positions at Synopsys, Cadence, Simplex, AMD, Altera and Intel.

Since 2019 he has been the Chief Architect and Technical Project Manager of OpenROAD since 2019.

We have [just heard the announcement](https://www.design-reuse.com/news/50383/efabless-openroad-openlane.html) that [OpenLANE](/terminology/openlane) will become the defacto flow for OpenROAD.

So I felt very lucky that he was willing to spend half an hour talking to us about a wide range of topics including:

* OpenROAD history & context
* What is the aim of OpenROAD
* State of the art in industry vs research
* Training the next generation of EDA developers
* Shortage of EDA developers
* Use of other PDKs besides Sky130
* Value of open source PDKs
* Roadmap and improvements: PPA
* Machine learning additions for OpenROAD
* Cloud scale compute for OpenROAD
* OpenLANE and OpenROAD collaboration announcement
* Future hopes
