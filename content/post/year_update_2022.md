Welcome to the Zero to ASIC highlights from 2022! It was a big year for open-source silicon, especially Zero to ASIC and [TinyTapeout](https://tinytapeout.com). Let's look at some of the highlights and goals for 2023.

{{< youtube bS2Siyw3i2M >}}

Here are a few of the highlights:
* Four Zero to ASIC tapeouts: [MPW5](/post/mpw5_submitted/), [MPW6](/post/mpw6_submitted/), [MPW7](/post/mpw7_submitted/), and [MPW8](/post/mpw8_submitted/)
* Rolled out TinyTapeout [01](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt01/) and [02](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/), helping nearly 250 tapeout their designs,
* I personally submitted by 19th tapeout
* Presented and hosted a TinyTapeout workshop at the Hackaday Con in Novemeber 2022. Met tons of people, including Sam Zeloof [@szeloof](https://twitter.com/szeloof).
* YouTube Channel had 82k views and 2.5k new subscribers
* Introduced [Siliwiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9xCa4RNfCM)


## Zero to ASIC Tapeouts
Zero to ASIC continued to grow with 280 new students in 2022 and submissions to four multi-project wafers (MPW)

Additionally, I received [MPW1](/post/mpw1-is-alive/) and [MPW2](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn/status/1588656855353790465?s=20), which I'm currently bringing up.

Personally I learned a lot about ASIC design, reaching my 19th tapeout. 

## Expanding Access to Open-Source Silicon
In addition to Zero to ASIC, I also launched the TinyTapeout program. 

TinyTapeout further lowers the barrier to entry in silicon. I was so excited to see kids submitting designs. The youngest submitter so far is 4-year-old Ms. Nguyen-Taylor with ["Heart Zoe Mom Dad"](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/031/).

It was also great to introduce Siliwiz, enabling people to get real-time feedback while designing circuits in silicon.

Keep an eye out for TinyTapeout 03 and further updates on Siliwiz in 2023!

## Social Media
In 2022 the top social media posts were:
* My [VGA clock](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn/status/1509491474722967553?s=20) submitted on MPW1
* Living in a world where my [9-year-old can design a chip](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn/status/1566377267298697221)
* Closing out [TinyTapeout 02](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn/status/1598736789119930380?s=20)

## Clarifying My Roles
There had been some confusion about my specific roles in the open-silicon community.

Currently I am working with
* [Yosys HQ](https://www.yosyshq.com/) on training, marketing, and sales
* [EFabless](https://efabless.com/) on community management and communications
* [Chipflow](https://www.chipflow.io/) on communications and building a system-on-chip with [Amaranth](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth)
* Zero to ASIC and TinyTapeout to low the barrier to ASIC design and help people get to their first tapeout

There has been a lot of confusion between the *Zero to ASIC course* and the [ZeroASIC](https://www.zeroasic.com/) startup. I'm not involved in their efforts, but feel fre to check out their site! They're developing a great Verilog-to-GDS flow called silicon compiler.

## Goals for 2023
Here are some of the goals I'd like to accomplish in 2023 with the community:
* Help the community submit 1000 more designs for fab!
* Continue contributing to open-source EDAs for FPGAs and ASICs
* Have our first European tapeout on [IHP](https://www.ihp-solutions.com/index.php?id=11)
* Get more chips working: complete the MPW2 bringup, as well as MPW3, 4, and 5.
* Submit my first analog design and assemble documentation to help others do the same
* Update the course, including more information about timing closure. This is a critical aspect of ASIC design, and there's not much information out there.
* Visit IHP and tour their foundry
* Meeting with Tomas Aidukas to do an [x-ray tomography scan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEvf16Op2U8) of the MPW1 designs
* Run TinyTapeout 03, 04, 05, and 06, with improvements in the scanchain multiplexer. I'm also keen to start working wiht more universities and schools.
* Taping out with SkyWater 90nm process
* Make the Zero to ASIC course more accessible, for example with the [low-cost ticket grant](/#grant)

## A Few Thoughts on Open-Source Silicon
* Hard to admit Moore's law is slowing down, but perhaps this is a good push towards more innovation
* There's still lots of room for innovation, such as advanced chip packaging and in application specific designs
* So few people have access to semiconductors despire their ubiquity. As we lower the barrier to silicon, we can hopefully bring even more creativity to the problems.

Here are two inspirational quotes on the topic:

*I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops.* - Jay Gould

*Thousands of geniuses live and die undiscovered - either by themselves or by other.* - Mark Twain
