Welcome to my highlights from 2022! It was a big year for open-source silicon, especially the Zero to ASIC course and [TinyTapeout](https://tinytapeout.com). Let's look at some of the highlights and then some aims for 2023.

Here are a few of the highlights:
* Four Zero to ASIC course tapeouts: [MPW5](/post/mpw5_submitted/), [MPW6](/post/mpw6_submitted/), [MPW7](/post/mpw7_submitted/), and [MPW8](/post/mpw8_submitted/)
* Rolled out TinyTapeout [01](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt01/) and [02](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/), helping nearly 250 people tapeout their designs,
* I personally submitted my 19th tapeout
* Presented and hosted a TinyTapeout workshop at the Hackaday SuperCon in Novemeber 2022. Met tons of people, including Sam Zeloof [@szeloof](https://twitter.com/szeloof).
* YouTube Channel had 82k views and 2.5k new subscribers
* Introduced [Siliwiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9xCa4RNfCM)


## Zero to ASIC course Tapeouts
The Zero to ASIC course continued to grow, we now have 280 students and made submissions to four multi-project wafers (MPW).

Additionally, I received [MPW1](/post/mpw1-is-alive/) and [MPW2](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn/status/1588656855353790465?s=20), which I'm currently bringing up.

Personally I learned a lot about ASIC design, reaching my 19th tapeout. 

## Expanding Access to Open-Source Silicon
In addition to Zero to ASIC, I also launched the TinyTapeout program. 

TinyTapeout further lowers the barrier to entry to silicon. I was so excited to see kids submitting designs. The youngest submitter so far is 4-year-old Ms. Nguyen-Taylor with ["Heart Zoe Mom Dad"](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/031/).

It was also great to introduce SiliWiz, enabling people to get real-time feedback while designing circuits in silicon.

Keep an eye out for TinyTapeout 03 and further updates on Siliwiz in 2023!

## Social Media
In 2022 my top social media posts were:
* My [VGA clock](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn/status/1509491474722967553?s=20) submitted on MPW1
* Living in a world where my [9-year-old can design a chip](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn/status/1566377267298697221)
* Closing out [TinyTapeout 02](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn/status/1598736789119930380?s=20)

## Clarifying My Roles
There had been some confusion about my specific roles in the open-silicon community.

Currently I am working with
* [Yosys HQ](https://www.yosyshq.com/) on training, marketing, and sales
* [EFabless](https://efabless.com/) on community management and communications
* [Chipflow](https://www.chipflow.io/) on communications and building a system-on-chip with [Amaranth](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth)
* Zero to ASIC course and TinyTapeout to lower the barrier to ASIC design and help people get to their first tapeout

There has been some confusion between the *Zero to ASIC course* and the [ZeroASIC](https://www.zeroasic.com/) startup. I'm not involved in their efforts, but feel free to check out their site! They're developing a great Verilog-to-GDS flow called silicon compiler.

## Goals for 2023
Here are some of the goals I'd like to accomplish in 2023 with the community:
* Help the community submit 1000 more designs for fab!
* Continue contributing to open-source EDAs for FPGAs and ASICs
* Have our first European tapeout on [IHP](https://www.ihp-solutions.com/index.php?id=11)
* Get more chips working: complete the MPW2 bringup, as well as MPW3, 4, and 5.
* Submit my first analog design and assemble documentation to help others do the same
* Update the course, including more information about timing closure. This is a critical aspect of ASIC design, and there's not much information out there.
* Visit IHP and tour their foundry
* Meet with Tomas Aidukas to do an [x-ray tomography scan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEvf16Op2U8) of the MPW1 designs
* Run TinyTapeout 03, 04, 05, and 06, with improvements to the scanchain multiplexer. I'm also keen to start working wiht more universities and schools.
* Taping out with SkyWater 90nm process
* Make the Zero to ASIC course more accessible, for example with the [low-cost ticket grant](/#grant)

## A Few Thoughts on Open-Source Silicon
* It's hard to admit Moore's law is slowing down, but perhaps this can be a good push towards more innovation
* There's still lots of room for innovation, such as advanced chip packaging and in application specific designs
* So few people have access to semiconductors despire their ubiquity. As we lower the barrier to silicon, we can hopefully bring even more creativity to the problems.
